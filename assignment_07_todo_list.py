# TASK: Console-Based To-Do List Application
#
# Build a simple to-do list program that runs entirely in the console and
# allows the user to manage their tasks interactively using a menu.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# FEATURES YOUR PROGRAM MUST SUPPORT
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
#   1. Add a Task
#      - Prompt the user to type a task description.
#      - Add it to the list and confirm it was added.
#
#   2. View All Tasks
#      - Display all tasks currently in the list, numbered from 1.
#      - If the list is empty, print a friendly message saying so.
#
#   3. Delete a Task
#      - Show the list of tasks with their numbers.
#      - Ask the user which task number they want to remove.
#      - Remove the task and confirm the deletion.
#      - If the task number is invalid, print an error message.
#
#   4. Quit
#      - End the program with a farewell message.
#
# Function to add a task
def add_task(tasks):
    task = input("Enter task: ")
    tasks.append(task)
    print(f'Task added: "{task}"')


# Function to view all tasks
def view_tasks(tasks):
    if len(tasks) == 0:
        print("Your to-do list is empty.")
    else:
        print("\nYour Tasks:")
        for i in range(len(tasks)):
            print(f"{i + 1}. {tasks[i]}")


# Function to delete a task
def delete_task(tasks):
    if len(tasks) == 0:
        print("There are no tasks to delete.")
        return

    view_tasks(tasks)

    task_number = int(input("Enter task number to delete: "))

    if 1 <= task_number <= len(tasks):
